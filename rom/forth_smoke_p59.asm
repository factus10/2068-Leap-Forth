; rom/forth_smoke_p59.asm — Phase 59 smoke ROM: COMPILE_ONLY_CHECK
; (compile-only words refused when typed at STATE=0)
;
; WHAT THIS PROVES: core/interp.asm's new COMPILE_ONLY_CHECK, called as
; the first instruction of IF/ELSE/THEN/BEGIN/UNTIL (core/control.asm),
; WHILE/REPEAT (core/loop.asm), DO/LOOP/+LOOP/LEAVE (core/doloop.asm),
; EXIT (core/loopext.asm), and `."` (core/dotquote.asm), only when the
; including ROM DEFINEs COMPILE_ONLY_CHECK_ENABLED (this file does, the
; same way rom/forth_boot.asm — the real, live, interactive ROM — does).
;
; THE BUG THIS CLOSES, RESTATED: every word above is IMMEDIATE, so
; core/interp.asm's own dispatch runs it unconditionally regardless of
; STATE. Before this phase, typing one directly at the interpreter
; prompt (STATE=0, no enclosing colon definition) silently compiled
; dead, unreachable bytes into the dictionary at HERE and left the
; "conditional"/"loop" with no actual effect on control flow — nothing
; crashed, but nothing behaved as typed either. docs/forth_tutorial.md
; used to claim these words "complain at the prompt"; they didn't,
; until now.
;
; THREE CHECKPOINTS TESTING THE REFUSAL, one per touched file, ALL
; using the exact same "feed a fixed source string to INTERPRET_RUN at
; STATE=0" technique every other smoke ROM in this project already uses
; for testing interpret-time behavior (see rom/forth_boot.asm's own
; header: "no live automated test exercises the interactive loop...
; that needs a real or simulated keyboard, not a fixed source string" —
; true for testing EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE's own line editing, irrelevant here
; since COMPILE_ONLY_CHECK only ever looks at STATE and WORD_BUF, both
; already fully exercised by a fixed string reaching INTERPRET_RUN
; exactly the same way a live-typed line eventually does):
;
;   1. `1 IF THEN ` (control.asm's IF)
;   2. `5 0 DO LOOP ` (doloop.asm's DO)
;   3. `." X" ` (dotquote.asm's `."`, the word literally named in the
;      original tutorial's false claim)
;
; Each checkpoint records HERE and the data-stack pointer (IX) before
; calling INTERPRET_RUN, then after the call asserts ALL of:
;   - HERE is completely unchanged (zero dead bytes compiled — the
;     guard fires as literally the first instruction of the word's own
;     body, before any COMPILE_CALL/COMPILE_WORD)
;   - IX is back at DSTACK_TOP (whatever was pushed before the
;     compile-only word was reached is cleanly discarded, matching
;     INTERPRET_UNKNOWN_WORD's own "abandon the rest of this line"
;     contract — the SAME hook this guard reuses, not a new one)
;   - INTERP_ERROR_FLAG is 1 (the line was reported as an error, not
;     silently swallowed)
;   - WORD_BUF holds the offending word's own counted-string bytes
;     (proving THIS specific word triggered the hook, not some
;     unrelated failure)
;
; FOURTH CHECKPOINT TESTING ZERO REGRESSION: a single colon definition
; using IF/ELSE/THEN, DO/LOOP, and `."` together, defined and called
; completely normally (`: DEMO 3 0 DO I . LOOP IF ." Y" ELSE ." N" THEN
; ;`), confirming the guard is invisible to legitimate compiling use —
; exactly the concern core/interp.asm's own COMPILE_ONLY_CHECK header
; states its "ret nz" fast path is designed to guarantee.
;
; Border goes GREEN (4) if all four pass; otherwise it shows the
; failing checkpoint's number. White (7) means this file's OWN test
; source hit a genuinely unexpected error (a bug in this smoke ROM,
; not in what it's testing) — see INTERPRET_UNKNOWN_WORD below for why
; that's still distinguishable from an EXPECTED refusal (checkpoints
; 1-3 call it on purpose and check its own effects directly, rather
; than treating "reached INTERPRET_UNKNOWN_WORD at all" as failure).
