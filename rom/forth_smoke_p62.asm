; rom/forth_smoke_p62.asm — Phase 62 smoke ROM: BREAK?
;
; TWO CHECKPOINTS, both real, neither needing a live keyboard --
; IO_CHECK_BREAK (kernel/io/io.asm) does its OWN fresh hardware
; keyboard-matrix scan on every call, unlike KEY/KEY?'s latched-sysvar
; mechanism (rom/forth_smoke_p36.asm's own checkpoints 4-6), so there
; is no sysvar to pre-seed for the "held" case the way KBD_KEYHIT/
; KBD_LASTK can be forced for KEY?. Confirming BREAK? actually reads
; TRUE when CAPS SHIFT+SPACE is really held needs a live or injected
; keyboard, same honest gap class as core/editor.asm's own
; EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE (see that file's header) -- not skipped here, just
; genuinely out of reach for an automated border-color smoke ROM.
;
;   1. BREAK? is FALSE on an idle bus (nothing pressed, real hardware
;      scan against Fuse's own unpressed keyboard state).
;   2. Calling BREAK? does not disturb KEY?'s own separate latched
;      state -- force KBD_KEYHIT=1 the same way rom/forth_smoke_p36.asm's
;      own checkpoint 5 does, call BREAK? (a real scan, discarded),
;      then confirm KEY? still reads TRUE afterward: proves the two
;      words' mechanisms are genuinely independent, not that one
;      silently consumes state the other relies on.
;
; Border goes GREEN (4) if both pass; otherwise it shows the failing
; checkpoint's number.
