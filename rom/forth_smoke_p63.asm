; rom/forth_smoke_p63.asm — Phase 63 smoke ROM: TONE, VOLUME, MIXER,
; NOISE, ENVELOPE
;
; SEVEN CHECKPOINTS, all data-stack-hygiene checks — same honest limit
; as core/sound.asm's own SOUND checkpoints (rom/forth_smoke_p32.asm):
; this project keeps no software shadow of the AY-3-8912's ports, and
; there is no way for a border-color smoke ROM to read back what the
; (emulated) chip's own registers actually hold, so "the right bytes
; reached the right registers" was hand-verified against the real
; AY-3-8912 register map instead (see each word's own header in
; core/sound.asm) rather than machine-checked here. What IS checked:
; every word consumes exactly its own stated stack arguments and
; nothing else, on both a representative valid input and (for TONE and
; VOLUME, the two words with an actual rejection path) an out-of-range
; channel.
;
;   1. TONE with a valid channel (1/Channel B) and period.
;   2. TONE with an out-of-range channel (3) — silently ignored.
;   3. VOLUME with a valid channel (2/Channel C) and level.
;   4. VOLUME with an out-of-range channel (200) — silently ignored.
;   5. MIXER with a representative mask — MIXER has no rejection path
;      (the mask is used as-is, not validated), so this is the only
;      checkpoint for it.
;   6. NOISE with a representative period — same reasoning, no
;      rejection path (masked, not validated).
;   7. ENVELOPE with a representative period and shape — same
;      reasoning, no rejection path.
;
; Border goes GREEN (4) if all seven pass; otherwise it shows the
; failing checkpoint's number.
