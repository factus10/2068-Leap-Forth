; core/soundext.asm — Phase 63: TONE, VOLUME, MIXER, NOISE, ENVELOPE
; (a channel-aware convenience layer over the raw AY-3-8912 register
; access core/sound.asm's own SOUND already provides)
;
; Builds on core/sound.asm (must be INCLUDEd first, with
; DICT_CHAIN_POINT left set to H_SOUND right before this file's own
; INCLUDE line — same chain-continuation convention as every other
; file in this project) and core/dict.asm/core/interp.asm (for
; DPOP_HL). Needs only include/hardware.inc (PORT_AY_REG/
; PORT_AY_DATA), like core/sound.asm itself.
;
; KEPT IN ITS OWN FILE, SEPARATE FROM core/sound.asm, deliberately:
; rom/forth_smoke_p52.asm's own embedded Blackjack test payload calls
; `SOUND` directly (several times) but none of the five words here —
; and that one ROM was already down to a single byte of headroom
; before this phase existed (see its own header). Folding these words
; into core/sound.asm itself would have forced every ROM that only
; ever needed `SOUND` to also pay for a whole convenience layer on top
; it never calls — exactly the situation core/floatmul.asm and core/
; floatdiv.asm already avoid by staying split from core/float.asm
; rather than folded in. rom/forth_smoke_p52.asm's own INCLUDE list
; stops at core/sound.asm; every ROM that wants the full layer
; (rom/forth_boot.asm, rom/forth_demo_blackjack.asm, and this phase's
; own rom/forth_smoke_p63.asm) INCLUDEs this file right after it.
;
; WHAT THIS ADDS: `TONE`/`VOLUME`/`MIXER`/`NOISE`/`ENVELOPE`, added
; directly (not derived) after the user asked whether raw register
; access "could be expanded to take better advantage of the
; hardware." Each of these five is a plain, mechanical wrapper around
; the AY-3-8912's own well-documented register map — no new design, no
; note/frequency tables, no sequencing: they're strictly shorthand for
; register writes `SOUND` could already do by hand. What they buy you:
; `SOUND` alone can't reach chip register 0 (Channel A's own
; tone-period FINE byte — see core/sound.asm's own header), and every
; caller otherwise has to remember the fine/coarse split, which
; channel maps to which register pair, and which bits in a given
; register mean what. These don't.
;
; NOT a shared internal routine with SOUND_WRITE, deliberately: that
; routine's own 1-16 numbering is a straight port of the real BASIC
; ROM's own `SOUND` command semantics, and (confirmed in core/
; sound.asm's own header) can NEVER select chip register 0 through any
; input value. Wrapper words that need genuine full-register reach
; route through their own native 0-15 AY_WRITE instead — matching the
; sibling `~/ts2068rom` project's own precedent exactly: it keeps the
; identical two-layer split, its BASIC-compatible `SOUND_EXROM` (1-16,
; rom/exrom_sound.asm) alongside a separate native-numbered `AYREG`
; extension (0-15, rom/extensions/ayreg.asm) for exactly this reason.
;
; AY-3-8912 register map used below (standard for this chip, not
; project-specific): 0/1 = Channel A tone period fine/coarse, 2/3 =
; Channel B, 4/5 = Channel C (only the low 4 bits of an odd/coarse
; register are significant — the chip ignores the rest); 6 = noise
; period (low 5 bits significant); 7 = mixer/enable (see MIXER's own
; header below for the bit layout); 8/9/10 = Channel A/B/C amplitude
; (low 4 bits = fixed volume 0-15, bit 4 = route this channel through
; the shared envelope generator instead — VOLUME below always clears
; that bit; see ENVELOPE's own header for why); 11/12 = envelope
; period fine/coarse (a full 16-bit value, unlike a tone period); 13 =
; envelope shape (low 4 bits significant).
;
; SAME OUT-OF-RANGE CONVENTION AS SOUND_WRITE: an out-of-range channel
; is silently ignored (nothing written to either AY port), matching
; this project's established "no general error-reporting mechanism"
; scope decision (see core/sound.asm's own header). Channel validation
; only inspects the low byte of the popped cell, same lightweight
; convention `BRIGHT`/`FLASH`'s own `and $01` uses for their own
; single-bit inputs — not exhaustive 16-bit range checking.

; period: a full 16-bit envelope period (registers 11 fine/12 coarse

; masking). shape: 0-15 (register 13, low 4 bits only) -- the AY-
; 3-8912's own four shape-control bits (continue/attack/alternate/
; hold); this word passes the value straight through rather than
; naming the eight resulting envelope curves, matching MIXER's own
; "faithful to the real register, not reinvented" choice above.
;
; DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ROUTE ANY CHANNEL THROUGH THIS ENVELOPE:
; on real AY-3-8912 hardware, there is exactly one shared envelope
; generator, and a channel only uses it if bit 4 of THAT channel's own
; amplitude register (8/9/10) is set -- VOLUME above always clears
; that same bit (fixed-volume mode), so ENVELOPE alone produces no
; audible change by itself. Setting bit 4 needs a raw register write
; this convenience layer doesn't offer, e.g. `8 16 SOUND` (register 8
; = Channel A's amplitude register, data 16 = $10 = bit 4 set, volume
; nibble 0) after calling ENVELOPE -- the same kind of "several
; coordinated writes, by hand" reality SOUND's own header already
; documents for a clean tone, not hidden here either.
